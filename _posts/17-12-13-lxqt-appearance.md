Open up the `LXQt Configuration Center` app and then open up `Appearance`.

In LXQt's Appearance settings, select the `gtk2` option for the Widget Style.  This will allow us to use any GTK theme that we want to theme pretty much all of the applications running on our system.

Next we'll go to the Icons Theme section in `Appearance`.  You can choose whatever icon theme you like.  I am using [Papirus icons + Breeze action icons ](https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1192944/) (the dark version).  The icons chosen here will only apply to Qt applications since we have `lxappearance` installed, but we'll take care of that later.

In the LXQt Theme section of `Appearance`, we want to make sure to select the `System` option so that the color from our GTK theme will be used for LXQt's panel, menus, etc.

In the Fonts section of `Appearance`, you can use whatever fonts you like.  I am using Noto Sans size 11.  The antialiasing, hinting, and DPI settings are also found here.

You can also select whatever Cursors in `Appearance`.  I am using the [Polar Cursor Theme](https://www.opendesktop.org/p/999968/).
