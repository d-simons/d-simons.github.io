An easy to configure .zshrc file with 256 color support, github status, program exit status, directory truncation, and sane defaults.  The `~/.zsh_aliases` file is also included with some useful aliases and functions (which can be ran just like a normal command).

# Configuration
On first run, `~/.zsh_prompt.conf` will be created.  This file contains all of the configuration options for the zsh prompt.  Color options may be previewed with `prompt_fg_samples` and `prompt_bg_samples`.
