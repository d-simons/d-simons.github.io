spm is a command line package manager that mainly provides AppImages.

## Github Rate Limit

By default, Github's rate limit for API checks is 60 per hour.  When authenticated, the rate limit is increased to 5000 per hour.  To take advantage of the increased rate limit, it is suggested that you add your token to `spm.conf`.

It is recommended that you do not give this token access to ***any*** scopes as it will be stored in plain text in your config file.  It may even be a good idea to create a throwaway account for use with this.

To use authenticated Github API checks with spm, edit the following line in `~/.local/share/spm/spm.conf` to contain your token:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN="YOURTOKEN"
```
