Open `Customize Look and Feel` in your menu to open `lxappearance`.  In the Widget tab, we'll select our GTK theme.  I am using [Breeze-gtk](https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1197982/) (dark version; included in Breeze-gtk download).  This theme will apply to pretty much all applications that we run on our system.

On the same tab just below the preview of the selected GTK theme is the font setting for GTK apps.  We'll want to make sure we used the same font as above.

The next tab in `lxappearance` is the Color tab, but this only applies if you are running LXDE, so we will skip this tab and move to the Icon Theme.  We'll want to make sure to select the same icon theme that we used above.

Once again in the Mouse Cursor tab of `lxappearance`, we'll want to make sure to select the same cursors as above.

In the Window Border tab of `lxappearance`, we will set the theme that Openbox uses for its window borders.  I am using a customized version of Minstral-Thin-Dark that is included in the `.themes` directory of this repo.

The final tab that we should cover here is the Font tab of `lxappearance`.  This contains the antialiasing and hinting settings for GTK fonts.  We'll want to make sure to use the same settings we used above.
