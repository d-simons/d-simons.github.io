AppImage builds for **[Discord Stable, PTB, and Canary](https://discordapp.com)**

All dependencies for AppImages built here are downloaded from Debian's repos.

The AppImages for Discord have an `--update` argument built in which will build a new AppImage in your `~/Downloads` directory in case a new release hasn't been updated below yet.

**[Discord Stable AppImage](https://github.com/simoniz0r/Discord-AppImage/releases)**

**[Discord PTB AppImage](https://github.com/simoniz0r/Discord-PTB-AppImage/releases)**

**[Discord Canary AppImage](https://github.com/simoniz0r/Discord-Canary-AppImage/releases)**

To use an AppImage, all you have to do is make it executable and run it!  No install or dependencies required, but the AppImages for Discord will prompt if you'd like to add them to your menu for easy access.
