My name is Dustin Simons.  I'm 29 years old and living in Wisconsin.  I mostly do random things with bash scripting in my free time.

My most active project is spm, a simple package manager written entirely in bash script.  spm has over 400 packages in its repository, most of which are AppImages that require no additional dependencies to use.
